            <p>I am about to graduate from University of Michigan's School of Information, with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>

            <p>In 2004, I entered The Ohio State University with the intention of receiving a BS in Molecular Genetics. Five years later, I graduated with dual BAs in history and anthropology. That type of experience has repeated throughout my life, and I have a great respect for that process. I was born in Ireland, but graduated high school in Cincinnati Ohio, having lived in San Francisco and Normandy, France during the intervening years. I began searching for graduate schools with the intention of pursuing Museum Studies, and now I am studying Human-Computer Interaction. No path is deterministic, and I purposefully remain aware of the unlimited possibilities of choice. Serendipity is everywhere.</p>

            <p>After receiving my undergraduate degrees, I was employed as an Archaeological Field Technician for 2 years. Commercial archaeology, as it turns out, is not the ideal setting for a meaningful investigation of human history, so it wasn't long after my entry into the field that I was looking for an exit strategy. My interest in human culture, the human experience, and history seemed to point towards a career within a museum, so with that in mind I began looking for appropriate graduate schools. It is only through luck and fate that I did not end up at a pure 'Museum Studies' school. After deciding that Archives and Records Management at Michigan would be the thing for me, I packed up my bags and moved from Columbus to Ann Arbor (Buckeyes gear included). It was not until I chose my classes for the first semester that I realized Human-Computer Interaction was intensely interesting to me, leaving me where I am today.</p>

            <p>When I'm not 'doing UX' I love hanging out with my dog and my fiancee. He's a cute-as-hell boston terrier and she's not too bad either. When the temperature is nice outside I really enjoy cycling and hiking (the one thing i miss from archaeology). My other passion is for wheels, be they bicycles, jeeps, motorcycles, or hot rods. I love to tinker with everything I can touch, and create whatever else I can think of.</p>
